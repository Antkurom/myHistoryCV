Example of variable:
I=10 // no space!

To use variable use $:
$I

If you want to connect it with another text without space use{}:
${I}abc

For arithmetical operations use $(()) construction:
I=$((I+10))

For a variables that user gave use $1, $2, $3, ...
$0 - mean name of the scrept that user enter to run a program
$# - mean number of variables user entered.
You can use also "" atribute for commands that use user variables to restrict
user give a minus atributes(-a) to the commands. 
If you want to include space use ""
$ sign works in "" but not in ''.

Example of if:
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
	cat "file.txt"
else
	echo "File file.txt not found"
fi

You can use any command as a condition, and if it completes successfully then
condition is true, else false.

Example of while:
I=1
while [ $I -le 100]; do
	echo $I
	I=$((I+1))
done

For standart conditional statements use:
-le - <=
-lt - <
-ge - >=
-gt - >

exmaple of for loop:

for C in red orange yellow green blue indigo violet; do
	echo $C
done

&& - and 
|| - or
